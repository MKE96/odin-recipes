        <h1><strong>Reuben Sandwich</strong></h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A Reuben is a grilled sandwich featuring corned beef on rye bread. The Reuben is a menu staple in Jewish-style delicatessens, but it's not technically kosher because it combines meat and cheese.
           A traditional reuben sandwich consists of thinly sliced corned beef, Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut on rye bread slathered with Russian or Thousand Island dressing. 
           Pair your Reuben with pickles, coleslaw, potato chips or French fries.</p>
